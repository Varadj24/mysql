    "'''1)SQL (Relational Databases):\n",
    "\n",
    "A)Data Structure: SQL databases use a tabular structure with rows and columns to store data. \n",
    "Data is organized into tables with predefined schemas, and each table is related to others\n",
    "through keys (e.g., primary keys and foreign keys).\n",
    "\n",
    "B)Data Integrity: SQL databases enforce data integrity constraints, \n",
    "such as primary keys, unique constraints, and foreign keys, \n",
    "to ensure data consistency and prevent data anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "C)Query Language: SQL databases use the Structured Query Language (SQL) for querying and manipulating data. \n",
    "SQL provides a powerful and standardized way to retrieve and manage data.\n",
    "\n",
    "D)Scaling: SQL databases are typically vertically scalable, \n",
    "meaning you can increase their capacity by upgrading hardware resources (e.g., CPU, RAM) of a single server. \n",
    "They may be less suitable for massive horizontal scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "E)Use Cases: SQL databases are commonly used for applications where data consistency, \n",
    "structured schemas, and ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions are essential. \n",
    "Examples include financial systems, e-commerce platforms, and content management systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2)NoSQL (Non-Relational Databases):\n",
    "\n",
    "A)Data Structure: NoSQL databases use various data models, including document-oriented, key-value, \n",
    "column-family, and graph-based. These models allow for flexible and schema-less data storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "B)Data Integrity: NoSQL databases often provide eventual consistency rather than strong consistency. \n",
    "They may relax some of the traditional ACID properties in favor of scalability and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "C)Query Language: NoSQL databases may use query languages specific to their data model. \n",
    "Some may support SQL-like queries, while others use different query languages or APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "D)Scaling: NoSQL databases are generally designed for horizontal scalability, \n",
    "making them suitable for handling large volumes of data and high-velocity workloads across distributed clusters of servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "E)Use Cases: NoSQL databases are well-suited for applications with dynamic and evolving data requirements, \n",
    "high volumes of data, and distributed architectures. Examples include social media platforms, \n",
    "real-time analytics systems, and IoT (Internet of Things) data storage.'''"

    "'''1).Primary Key:\n",
    "\n",
    "1)Definition: \n",
    "   A primary key is a constraint in a relational database table that uniquely identifies each record (row) in the table. \n",
    "It ensures that no two records in the table have the same value for the primary key column(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "2)Properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "A)Uniqueness: Each value in the primary key column(s) must be unique across all rows in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "B)Non-null: The primary key column(s) cannot contain NULL (missing) values.\n",
    "\n",
    "C)Unchanging: Primary key values should generally not change once assigned to a record.\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: The primary key serves as a means to identify and reference individual records within the table. \n",
    "It establishes a relationship between the data in the table and other tables in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "3)Example: \n",
    "   In a \"Customers\" table, the \"CustomerID\" column can be designated as the primary key. It ensures that each customer has a unique identifier.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2).Foreign Key:\n",
    "\n",
    "1)Definition: A foreign key is a constraint in a relational database table that establishes \n",
    "a link between two tables based on the values of one or more columns. \n",
    "The foreign key in one table refers to the primary key in another table.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)Properties:\n",
    "A)Referential Integrity: The foreign key enforces referential integrity, \n",
    "ensuring that values in the foreign key column(s) match values in the primary key column(s) of the referenced table.\n",
    "\n",
    "B)Relationship: Foreign keys create relationships between tables, allowing data to be linked and ensuring data consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "3)Purpose: Foreign keys are used to create associations and relationships between tables in a database. \n",
    "They enable the enforcement of data integrity rules and support the concept of data normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "4)Example: In an \"Orders\" table, the \"CustomerID\" column can be a foreign key that references \n",
    "the \"CustomerID\" column in the \"Customers\" table. This establishes a relationship between orders and customers,\n",
    "ensuring that orders are associated with valid customers.'''"
